Comparison of 
Transformer-based Models, GAN-based, Seq2Seq, Deep Neuron Nets
1.	Tacotron 2:
o	Architecture: Encoder-decoder with attention mechanism and WaveNet vocoder.
o	Use Case: High-quality text-to-speech synthesis for creating realistic voice clones.
o	Example: Used by Google for generating natural-sounding speech from text.
2.	WaveNet:
o	Architecture: Autoregressive generative model with dilated convolutions.
o	Use Case: High-fidelity speech generation, often used as a vocoder.
o	Example: Can be integrated with other models like Tacotron 2 for improved speech quality.
3.	FastSpeech 2:
o	Architecture: Non-autoregressive transformer-based TTS model.
o	Use Case: Fast and high-quality speech synthesis with prosody control.
o	Example: Suitable for real-time applications due to its efficient generation process.
4.	HiFi-GAN:
o	Architecture: GAN-based model with multi-scale discriminators.
o	Use Case: High-fidelity audio synthesis, can be used as a vocoder for TTS systems.
o	Example: Provides a good balance between speed and audio quality.
